## Business Model

We would use the same buisness model as Google for their Android platform where the main code is open source but then we package it with the option for propietary software that makes the matches more relevent as opposed to being just randomly matched with eachother.


## Why We Chose Our License

We chose this license so that larger companies, like Tinder, would be less likely to try and use our code since they would be unable to make it private.
